                I think that i am going for the rx 580, i&#039;ve done some research and i think that this is the best card under $200. So overheating isn&#039;t an issue here. The 4 best graphics cards in 2020 (that you can buy right now).
    </p>

    <h3>This geforce gtx 1060 from evga may be old in the tooth, but for under $250 it&#039;s an absolute bargain that provides a premium gaming experience at a low price tag.</h3>
    <p>Each of these graphics cards costs less than $200 and will deliver a great 1080p pc gaming experience. Most of the gtx 1060 cards with 6gb vram cost above $200, therefore i have listed the 3gb variant which is a perfect competitor of rx 570 4gb under 200 dollars. Best graphics card overall, for 4k and more. The msi computer graphics card (gtx 1050 ti 4g oc) is a solid device, backed by a reliable manufacturer with tons of experience creating quality products.</p>
