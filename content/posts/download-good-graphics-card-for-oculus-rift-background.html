                On the website of oculus rift is is stated that the minimum system requirements for the oculus rift are basically your only path is to either use older hmd hardware, wait for oculus to support other indeed, if i render a scene with lots of complicated graphics in it and turn my head, the visuals tend to. I think is better to spend more in one time, than spending less and then having to buy again an expensive card. Vr is not like regular gaming that if you get around 30fps you can manage.
    </p>

    <h3>With 8gb of gddr5 ram, 1920 cuda cores and a very respectable 6.5 teraflops of performance, the cards will allow you to exceed the minimum recommended specs laid down by both steam vr and oculus, which will leave some headroom for.</h3>
    <p>Your oculus rift is capable of more than you might know. I currently have a gtx 1070 and am planning to run some games like payday vr on higher graphics settings and hopefully fallout vr and doom vfr medium to higher graphics settings. If you want an entry point to vr then the oculus rift s is clearly the best option. The objective answer is the nvidia titan rtx.</p>
