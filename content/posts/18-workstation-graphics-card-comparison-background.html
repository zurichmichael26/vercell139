                As the name suggests, integrated graphics means that the gpu is integrated onto the cpu die and shares memory with the processor. Gpus in amd&#039;s radeon™ pro, radeon rx and. The peak performance is simlar to the older p4000, but the memory bus is cut down to 192 bit (from 256 bit).
