                I have a macbook pro 2011 (8,2) which suffers from the infamous graphic card problems. The 2011 macbook pro has, for almost a decade, been the exception to that rule. I tried the apple hardware check, and there were nothing wrong in the results.

    <p>Want to upgrade the ram, graphics card, processor, storage (ssd or hard drive) or even use an optical drive in a mac to add an ssd? Hopefully waiting for an apple replacement program i want to disable the discrete graphics and enable only the intel hd3000 chip in the i7.
