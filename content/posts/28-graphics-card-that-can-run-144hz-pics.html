    <p>I just built my new pc and i don&#039;t have a graphics card yet, but i have a 144hz monitor and a dual link dvi to connect to motherboard. It&#039;s just a little task. The graphics card is the most important component of any gaming pc build. Based on your own experience, which is better to get, amd or nvidia?</p>
